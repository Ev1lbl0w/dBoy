# dBoy - A Gameboy (Color) emulator in D language!

## Why another Gameboy emulator?

Because I'm learning how emulators are written, and Gameboy seems the best device for me to start. I decided to write it on D language and use Aurora framework too to test it.

## Planned features

- Game booting (Tetris)
- Savestates
- Sound support
- Peripheral support
